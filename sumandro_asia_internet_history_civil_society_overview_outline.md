6.1. Civil Society - Overview

**6.1.1. Introduction – Civil Society at the WSIS**

The first conference of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was held in Geneva in December 2003. Through the processes of organising this conference, and the second one in Tunis in November 2005, United Nations expressed a clear intention of great participation of actors from the private companies, civil society, academia, and media, along with the governmental organisations. Towards this goal, the Civil Society Subcommittee on Content and Themes (WSIS-SCT) was established at the first Preparatory Committee meeting (PrepCom-1) of WSIS so as to complement the efforts being undertaken by the Inter-Governmental Subcommittee 2 on Content of Themes of the conferences. At the second Preparatory Committee meeting (PrepCom-2), in Geneva in February 2003, WSIS-SCT produced a summary of the views of its members titled 'Vision and Principles of Information and Communication Societies,' and also a one page brief titled 'Seven Musts: Priority Principles Proposed by Civil Society' to be used for lobbying purposes. This brief mentioned seven key principles of Internet governance according to the members of WSIS-SCT: (1) Sustainable Development, (2) Democratic Governance, (3) Literacy, Education, and Research, (4) Human Rights, (5) Global Knowledge Commons, (6) Cultural and Linguistic Diversity, and (7) Information Security [1]. Asian Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) that took part in the PrepCom-2 meeting included Arab Business Forum for Information and Communication Technology, Arab Commission for Human Rights, Asian Media Information and Communication Centre, Bangladesh Friendship Education Society, D.Net - Development through Access to Network Resources, Datamation Foundation Charitable Trust, Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era, Drishtee Foundation, Japan Civil Liberties Union, Japan Computer Access for Empowerment, Japan Trade External Organization, Kuwait Information Technology Society, OneWorld International, ILAM – Centre for Arab Palestinians in Israel, Information and Communication Technology Development Program, Bangladesh, International University of Japan, Iranian Youth ICT NGO, Iranian Civil Society Organizations Training and Research Centre, Islamic Women's Institute of Iran, IT for Change.

Anita Gurumurthy and Parminder Jeet Singh of IT for Change, who were present at the PrepCom-2, noted several key features of the discussion at the meeting that have been felt time and again in Internet governance summits since [2]. Firstly, they indicated that the government agencies present in the dialogues tend to take diverging positions in international events and domestic contexts. Secondly, there was a marked absence of formal and informal discussions between the governmental and the civil society representatives of the same country present at the meeting. The government agencies were clearly disinterested in involving civil society organisations in the process. Thirdly, the civil society actors present in there were mostly from ICT for Development sector, and the organisation working in more 'traditional' sectors – such as education, health, governance reform, etc. – remained absent from the conversations. They noted that this was more of a concern for civil society organisation from South Asia, even in comparison to those from West and East Asia.

Parallel to the WSIS-SCT process, the Asia Pacific Regional Conference on the WSIS was held in Tokyo, Japan, in January 13-15, 2003 for various stakeholders from the Asia-Pacific region to discuss the topics to be addressed in WSIS Geneva and Tunis, and to draft a join a declaration regarding governing and advancing the information society in the region. The Conference was attended by government agencies of 37 countries and territories, 58 private companies, 199 civil society organisations, and 26 international organisations. Civil society actors, however, were effectively sidelined in this Conference, which led to them to producing a join statement of Asian civil society organisations to ensure that their positions are presented at the global discussion [3].

Statement of the Civil Society in Response to the WSIS Draft Declaration [4]:

“The information society described in the document is characterized by uniformity, technocracy and bargaining. It lacks any vision that is people and citizen centered: there is little or no mention of the poor, workers and marginalized groups including indigenous people, refugees, people with disabilities. The emphasis on diversity of peoples, cultures and ways of living is still far from sufficient. Our contributions throughout this process of shaping a common vision of an inclusive, democratic and sustainable information society, have not been given serious consideration”.

Categorising of the issues emerging from the inputs by Asian civil society organisations during WSIS into four major clusters – (1) Human Rights and Internet, (2) Digital Divide and Different Needs of Users, (3) Access to and Accessibility of Knowledge, and (4) Internet Governance and Economy. The next sections map the activities and contributions of Asian CSOs on these topic clusters across various global and regional summits during 2001-2010.

**6.1.7. Epilogue: Questioning 'Civil Society' and Institutional Frameworks for Internet Governance**

Formation of international alliances among civil society organisations to more effectively participate in various international Internet governance summits, to consolidate civil society voices and efforts. Discontent among civil society regarding the 'alleged' capture of the civil society space in global conversations by direct or indirect representatives of other kinds of entities – from governments to private companies. Both these issues – of international alliances and of capturing of civil society spaces – are intimately tied to the human and financial constraints faced by these organisations in participating at the various crucial Internet governance events. This is further complicated by the rising discontent among civil society organisations regarding the effectiveness of IGF and other such global and regional forums as spaces of discussing and shaping governance of Internet.

The agenda of reforming global Internet governance institutions and processes – from efforts to claim civil society spaces within the mainstream global Internet governance spaces, to movement towards separated and ideologically-aligned conglomerations of civil society actors.
